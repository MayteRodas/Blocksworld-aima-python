# Blocksworld-aima-python
An implementation of the Blocksworld problem with aima python.
The problem is the classic Blocksworld problem extended with weights and capacities.
Given a block, with a certain weight, the goal is to find a certain path to move the block on top of another block that has a sufficient capacity.

In order to obtain the execution of the problem, it is requested to download aima-python and after that you need to copy the file "search_finale.py" into the aima-python installation folder.

To execute the file, it is sufficient to load the file with python 3.x:

python3.7 -i search_finale.py 

This command will lead to the execution of the problem written in the class called "Blocco".
